Week 2 Capstone Workshop



This project contains the administration system of a theoretical library, with all the required logic and classes built in.

Each book in the library is a custom-made object, which is declared in its own file (Book.java), and are stored in an array in the main file (Screen.java).

I would argue that the most interesting part of the program are the nested function calls, as the functions for checking in and out books are both called from inside main, and inside the relevant functions for displaying all that the library has on offer. This is not something that was ever discussed in class itself, and is something I learned on my own.



The code for the main function of Screen.java is shown below
